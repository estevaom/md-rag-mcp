# Navigating the After-Work Drinks

Had after-work drinks with the team tonight. I always dread these things a little. Making small talk with colleagues I don't know well triggers my social anxiety quite badly. I feel awkward, unsure what to say, constantly worrying about saying the wrong thing.

Managed to have a couple of decent conversations, but mostly hovered near the edge, nursing a drink. Felt that familiar tightness in my chest and the urge to just leave. Stayed for about an hour before making my excuses. It's draining pretending to be outgoing when you're naturally introverted and anxious in those settings. Glad it's over.
