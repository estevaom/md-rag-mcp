# Eating My Way Through Japan

One of the best parts of the Japan trip has definitely been the food. Had some incredible ramen in Kyoto â€“ rich, flavorful broth and perfectly cooked noodles. Totally different from the instant stuff back home.

Also tried authentic sushi at a small place near the Nishiki Market. The freshness of the fish was unbelievable. And the takoyaki (octopus balls) in Osaka were a fantastic street food snack. Haven't been brave enough to try natto (fermented soybeans) yet, maybe next time! Every meal feels like an adventure here.
