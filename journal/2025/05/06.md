# Hiking Through Fushimi Inari

Visited the Fushimi Inari shrine today, famous for its thousands of vibrant red torii gates winding up the mountainside. It was even more impressive than the pictures.

Walking through the tunnels of gates felt magical, especially further up the path where the crowds thinned out. It was quite a hike to the summit, but the views over Kyoto were worth the effort. Saw many smaller shrines and fox statues (Inari's messengers) along the way. A truly unique and spiritual place. Felt a sense of peace walking back down as the sun began to set.
