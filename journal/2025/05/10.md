# Tackling a LeetCode Problem

Tried solving a medium-difficulty problem on LeetCode today involving graph traversal (finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph). My first instinct was to use Depth First Search (DFS), but quickly realized Breadth First Search (BFS) is better suited for shortest path problems.

Took a while to get the implementation right, especially handling visited nodes correctly to avoid infinite loops. Had to sketch it out on paper first. Finally got the solution accepted after a few attempts. It's satisfying when you work through a complex problem logically and arrive at a correct, efficient solution. Keeps the problem-solving skills sharp.
