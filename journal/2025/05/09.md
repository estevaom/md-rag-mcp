# Hooked on Hades

Started playing Hades on a recommendation. Wow, this game is addictive! It's a roguelike, which I usually bounce off, but the combination of fast-paced combat, engaging story, amazing art style, and incredible voice acting has me completely hooked.

Each run feels different thanks to the random boons from the Greek gods. Even when I die (which is often), I feel like I'm making progress by unlocking new abilities or learning enemy patterns. It manages to make failure part of the fun narrative loop. Supergiant Games really nailed this one.
