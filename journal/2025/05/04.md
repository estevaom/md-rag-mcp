# Contemplating Morbid Angel Lyrics

Listened to Morbid Angel's "Altars of Madness" again today. While the music itself is iconic death metal, I was paying more attention to the lyrics this time. They're steeped in Lovecraftian horror, occultism, and anti-religious themes.

It's interesting how extreme metal often explores these darker aspects of existence, mythology, and philosophy. It's not just noise; there's often a conceptual depth, albeit a bleak one. Lyrics about ancient gods, cosmic horror, and damnation â€“ definitely not cheerful stuff, but it fits the abrasive sound perfectly. A form of escapism into darker fantasy, perhaps.
