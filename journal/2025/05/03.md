# Juggling Too Many Projects

Feeling completely swamped at work this week. Multiple deadlines are converging, and there are constant interruptions with urgent requests. It feels like I'm constantly switching contexts and not making enough progress on any single task.

My shoulders are tense just thinking about the backlog. Need to get better at prioritizing or pushing back, but it's hard when everything feels important. Just the thought of opening my email tomorrow morning fills me with a sense of dread. Hoping I can catch up over the weekend, but I really shouldn't have to.
