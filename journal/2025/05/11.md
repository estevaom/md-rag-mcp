# Quiet Day Indoors

It's been raining non-stop all day. Usually, I find constant rain a bit gloomy, but today it felt quite cozy. Spent the afternoon reading a book by the window, listening to the rain drumming against the glass.

There's something calming about having a legitimate excuse to just stay indoors and do nothing productive. Let the world outside rush by while slowing down inside. Brewed some tea, put on some ambient music. A simple, peaceful Sunday. Sometimes these quiet, uneventful days are exactly what's needed to recharge before the week begins.
