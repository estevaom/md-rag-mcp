# Diving into Docker

Started learning Docker today. It's been on my list for ages, and it seems essential for modern development workflows, especially for managing dependencies and ensuring consistent environments.

Went through some tutorials, built a simple Python Flask app, and containerized it using a Dockerfile. It was surprisingly straightforward once I grasped the basic concepts of images and containers. Being able to package the app and its environment together feels powerful. Still need to explore Docker Compose for multi-container applications, but it's a good start. Definitely see the benefits.
