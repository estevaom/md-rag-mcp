# CSS Alignment Nightmare

Wrestled with some tricky CSS alignment issues on a web component today. Trying to get flexbox items to wrap correctly while maintaining vertical alignment across different screen sizes was proving surprisingly difficult. Spent ages tweaking properties in the browser's developer tools.

It's often these seemingly simple layout tasks in JavaScript/CSS that end up consuming the most time. Finally figured out a combination of `align-items`, `flex-wrap`, and a media query that seems to work reliably. Frontend development requires a lot of patience and pixel-pushing sometimes.
