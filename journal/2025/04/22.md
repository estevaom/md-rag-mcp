# Learning "Wish You Were Here"

Spent some time today trying to learn the intro riff to Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here" on the acoustic guitar. The G chord transition is still a bit tricky for me, my fingers don't quite land cleanly every time.

Watched a couple of tutorial videos which helped break down the strumming pattern. It's slow progress, but satisfying when a small section starts to sound recognizable. Need to keep practicing the chord changes until they become muscle memory. Maybe tomorrow I'll try tackling the first verse.
