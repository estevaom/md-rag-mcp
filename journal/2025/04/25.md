# Debugging the Data Pipeline

Spent most of the day refactoring that old Python script for the data pipeline. It had grown organically over time and was becoming a real mess to maintain. Decided to break down the main function into smaller, more manageable pieces with clear inputs and outputs.

Found a subtle bug related to date handling that was causing occasional errors downstream. It was tricky to spot, hidden in a nested loop. Adding some unit tests now to hopefully prevent regressions in the future. It feels good cleaning up technical debt, even if it's not the most glamorous work. Much more readable now.
