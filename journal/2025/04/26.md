# Exploring Kyoto

Following the Osaka trip, took the Shinkansen (bullet train) to Kyoto. What a contrast! Kyoto feels much more traditional and serene compared to Osaka's bustling energy.

Visited Kinkaku-ji (the Golden Pavilion) today. It was absolutely breathtaking, shimmering gold reflected in the pond. It was quite crowded, but still managed to find some peaceful moments walking through the gardens. Also explored the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove â€“ walking amongst those towering stalks felt otherworldly. Japan continues to amaze. Need to plan a visit to Fushimi Inari shrine soon.
