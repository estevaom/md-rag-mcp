# Bleed the Future on Repeat

Finally got around to listening to the latest Archspire album, "Bleed the Future", properly today. It's absolutely relentless. The speed and technicality are just off the charts, especially Oli Peters' vocals. How does he even breathe?

Tracks like "Golden Mouth of Ruin" and "Drone Corpse Aviator" are standouts. The drumming is insane, pure controlled chaos. It's not for everyone, obviously, but for technical death metal, it's top-tier stuff. Put it on while coding and felt incredibly focused, strangely enough. The sheer intensity is captivating.
