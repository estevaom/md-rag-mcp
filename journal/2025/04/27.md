# Misunderstanding Over Dinner

Had a stupid argument with my wife tonight over something completely trivial â€“ I think it was about weekend plans. It escalated quickly, though. Voices were raised, things were said that probably shouldn't have been.

The atmosphere in the house feels heavy now. Sitting here, my chest feels tight, and I keep replaying the conversation in my head, wondering how it went so wrong. It's that familiar knot in my stomach. We both need to cool off, but these moments always leave me feeling drained and unsettled for hours afterwards. Communication breakdown is the worst.
