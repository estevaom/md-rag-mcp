# Daily Reflection - April 18, 2025

Felt quite anxious today because of the upcoming presentation. Didn't sleep well last night which probably made it worse. Tried to focus on the AI course material in the evening, which helped distract me a bit. Need to prepare more for the talk tomorrow. Had a few beers while studying, maybe too many.
