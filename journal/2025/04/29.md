# One More Turn... Famous Last Words

Got sucked into a game of Civilization VI tonight, playing as the Romans. Planned to just play for an hour, but suddenly it was past midnight. The "one more turn" syndrome is real.

It's fascinating how the game blends history, strategy, and resource management. Trying to balance expansion, science, culture, and military is a constant juggling act. Managed to secure a science victory pathway, focusing on building campuses and libraries. It's satisfying seeing your empire grow and advance through the ages, even if it means neglecting sleep sometimes. A much less stressful gaming experience than Elden Ring lately!
