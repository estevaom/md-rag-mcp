# Phone Call with Mom

Had a phone call with my mother earlier. It started okay, but then veered into the usual territory â€“ criticisms about my choices, comparisons to others. I tried to stay calm, but ended up getting defensive.

These calls always trigger my anxiety. I feel this immense pressure and guilt, like I'm never doing enough or living up to expectations. My palms were sweating by the end of it. It's exhausting navigating these conversations. I know she means well, probably, but it just leaves me feeling inadequate and stressed out for the rest of the day. Need to find better coping mechanisms for this.
