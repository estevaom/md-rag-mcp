# Ears Ringing, Worth It

Went to see Cattle Decapitation live tonight. Absolutely insane energy. The venue was packed, sweaty, and loud â€“ exactly as it should be. Travis Ryan's vocal range is even more impressive in person, switching between gutturals and those high shrieks effortlessly.

They played a lot from "Death Atlas" and "Terrasite". The pit was wild during "Bring Back the Plague". It's a cathartic experience, that wall of sound hitting you. My ears are definitely ringing, and my neck will probably be sore tomorrow, but it was totally worth it. Live metal is just a different beast.
