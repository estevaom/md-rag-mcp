# Osaka Adventure

The flight to Osaka was quite smooth. Managed to get a window seat, which was fantastic. As we approached Japan, the clouds cleared briefly, and I was lucky enough to catch a stunning view of Mount Fuji! Its iconic snow-capped peak was unmistakable, even from the air. It felt like a good omen for the trip.

Landing at Kansai International Airport, built on an artificial island, was an experience in itself. Looking forward to exploring the city, trying takoyaki, and visiting Osaka Castle.
