# Daily Reflection - April 19, 2025

The presentation went much better than expected! Felt a huge sense of relief afterwards. Mood improved significantly. Talked with Sarah after the meeting, which was nice - actual conversation, not just work chat. Only had one beer tonight to celebrate. Feeling more positive. Spent a little time on the AI course but less than yesterday. Briefly went outside for some air.
