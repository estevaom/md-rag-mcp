# First Loaf of Bread

Decided to try baking bread today. Found a simple recipe online for a basic white loaf. The process of mixing the dough, kneading it, and waiting for it to rise was surprisingly therapeutic. Kneading was harder work than I expected!

The smell while it was baking was incredible. It didn't come out perfectly - the crust was a bit too thick and it was slightly dense - but it tasted pretty good, especially warm with some butter. Definitely learned a few things for next time, like maybe not adding quite so much flour during kneading and checking the oven temperature more carefully. Overall, a fun experience.
