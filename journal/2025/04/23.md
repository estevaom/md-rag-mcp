# Stuck on Malenia Again

Spent hours trying to beat Malenia in Elden Ring tonight. It's just brutal. That Waterfowl Dance attack gets me every single time. I can feel my heart pounding and a wave of anxiety wash over me every time she leaps into the air. It's supposed to be fun, but right now it just feels like hitting a brick wall. The frustration is immense. Maybe I need to respec or just take a break for a few days. It's genuinely stressing me out more than it should.
